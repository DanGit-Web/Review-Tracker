# Review-Tracker
As part of my work in the rotational development program, I designed, developed, and implemented a software application for daily management and team support. 
Specifically, I closely collaraborated with the operations supervisors to create an application that gave them a  platform document and track employee skills as part of employee training, development, and annual performance review process.  
This application included data entry, along with a database for tracking and trending, and a reporting feature for the supervisors. As a result of this application, we improved the effectiveness and efficiency of our training 
program and our annual performance review process.
